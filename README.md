  ðŸŽ® Web game based on PokÃ©monâ„¢ series for the web ðŸŽ®
</p>

---

PokÃ©m00n is a game developed using MongoDB as database, HTML, CSS and Javascript with the support of the Handlebars view engine for the frontend (we also used Phaser.JS library as game engine), and both Node.JS and Socket.IO for the backend based on the PokÃ©monâ„¢ series that seeks to revive and reinvent the gameplay experience of the franchise games for portable consoles through an interface built for web. This project was developed to a project for the course ACH2006 - Information Systems Engineering I at USP.

## Getting started
PokÃ©m00n complete installation depends on both having a MongoDB service running and npm installed. Run the following commands in the root directory to initialize PokÃ©m00n:

```
npm install # to install all npm dependencies
node index.js # to actually run the app
```
